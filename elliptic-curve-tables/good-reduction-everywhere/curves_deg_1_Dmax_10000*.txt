  "About": "This file considers all number fields K with deg(K) = Degree and abs_disc_min <= |disc(K)| <= abs_disc_max and contains the set of all* elliptic curves over K (up to K-isomorphism) with everywhere good reduction. The entries of this table are tuples (K,Es), where K is a number field and Es is a list of tuples (c4,c6). Only those K are listed for which the computed list of curves is non-empty. Each number field K is given by the minimal polynomial of a primitive element. Each curve in this table is given as a tuple (c4, c6) of elements in K, which in particular determines a Weierstrass model Y^2 = X^3 - 27*c4*X - 54*c6 of the curve.",
  "*Completeness": "Conditional under GRH: All fields K in the mentioned range are considered, however the completeness of the list of curves over that field is conditional on GRH.",

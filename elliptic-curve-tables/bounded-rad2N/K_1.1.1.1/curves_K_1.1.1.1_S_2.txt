  "About": "This file contains the set of all* elliptic curves over K (up to K-isomorphism) with good reduction outside S, where K is the number field generated by a root x of the given polynomial, and S is a set of prime ideals in K each of which is given by their generators. Each curve in this table is given as a tuple (c4, c6) of elements in K, which in particular determines a Weierstrass model Y^2 = X^3 - 27*c4*X - 54*c6 of the curve.",

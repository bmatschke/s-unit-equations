# Elliptic curves with good reduction away from 2

Let `M(2,K)` denote the set of all elliptic curves over K with good reduction outside the primes above 2.

### Contents

Each folder `K_deg_XXX_S_2` contains sets `M(2,K)` for certain number fields of degree XXX, including all with `|disc(K)| <= 10000`.

### Completeness 

As in all tables of this repository, the completeness of the computed sets `M(2,K)` may be conditional on GRH, in which case this is signified by an asterisk `*` in the filename. 
 
All fields K with `|disc(K)| <= 10000` are considered.
More precisely:
For a fixed degree n, all fields K of degree n up to `|disc(K)| <= B(n)` are considered, where `B(n)` is given in the following table:
    
     n        B(n)
    ---------------
     2       10000
     3       10000
     4       10000
     5       50000
     6      100000
     7     1000000

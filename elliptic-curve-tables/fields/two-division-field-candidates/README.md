# Two-division-field candidates

This folder contains files ``fields_K_XXX_S_YYY.sobj``.

Any such file contains all* field extensions L/K such that

- K is the number field given by LMFDB label XXX,
- L is the splitting field of some degree 3 polynomial over the number field K, and 
- L/K is unramified outside S, where S is the set of primes in K above YYY. 

An asterisk `*` in the filename signifies that the completeness is conditional on GRH.

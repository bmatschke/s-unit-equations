# Number fields unramified outside S

This folder contains files such as ``fields_degD_SN*.sobj``.

They contain all* defining polynomials of number fields of degree ``D`` that are unramified outside the first ``N`` rational primes.

An asterisk `*` in the filename means that the result is conditional on GRH.

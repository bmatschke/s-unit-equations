# Number fields unramified outside S

This folder contains files such as ``fields_degD_SN*.sobj``.

They contain all* defining polynomials of number fields of degree ``D`` that are unramified outside the first ``N`` rational primes.

An asterisk `*` in the filename means that the result is conditional on GRH.

Previously these tables of cubic fields were only known for `N <= 8` (available in the [LMFDB](https://www.lmfdb.org/NumberField/)).
These were computed by [Jones and Roberts](https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.0266) via a different method, namely Belabas' [cubic](https://www.math.u-bordeaux.fr/~kbelabas/research/cubic.html).

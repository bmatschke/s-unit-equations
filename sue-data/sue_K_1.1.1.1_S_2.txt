  "About": "This file contains the solutions of the S-unit equation lambda_x * x + lambda_y * y = 1 over the given number field K, for given coefficients lambda_x and lambda_y in K, and where x and y are S-units for the given set of prime ideals S. For any solution (x,y), only x is stored in this file.",
